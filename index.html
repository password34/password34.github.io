                    <h1>LISA</h1>
                    <p>Lisa is a proficient witch; as such, she enjoys everything related to the elements and items that would help her understand them. Despite her position as Librarian, Lisa takes it somewhat haphazardly as she appears to be relatively
                        bored dealing with normal books, instead preferring those in the restricted section. She still takes the job seriously nonetheless, and will personally go out to collect books that are long overdue, albeit in a way that she can
                        still enjoy the smaller things in life. Her haphazard, carefree personality comes from her Vision, as while the gods gave it to her and she was sated with knowledge she wanted to learn, they did not tell her what the price was,
                        and she began fearing the truth behind them.This in turn caused her to become rather paranoid, and she left Sumeru out of fear that she was paying too high a price for knowledge, relegating herself to categorization and management
                        of the library, usually refusing to take any other duties unless absolutely necessary.When Lisa is angered, the surrounding air near her becomes electrified in part due to her Electro Vision. Depending on the severity of what has
                        angered her, she can either be simply irritated or become extremely scary, the latter also causing her to dispense "appropriate" punishment. Lisa seems to be fond of the Traveler, and sometimes acts flirtatious as she typically
                        refers to the Traveler as "cutie" or "darling", and she admits they're special to her.She loves tea and thinks that afternoon tea is the most important part of her day. She sometimes takes tea with vegetable soup as she once used
                        to enjoy this with Jean at the Good Hunter restaurant. She also suffers from cucurbitophobia, a fear of pumpkins.</p>

                    <h1>Hu Tao</h1>
                    <p>At first glance, she appears to be a quirky and cheerful girl. No one would think that she is actually the renowned and illustrious Hu Tao. Whether she is acting as the Director of the Wangsheng Funeral Parlor or as Liyue Harbor's
                        "famous" poet, Hu Tao's nature is exceedingly eccentric. Like lightning or sparks of flame, she always comes and goes in the blink of an eye, igniting everything around her. She pens poems by the oil of midnight and flits across
                        mountains and seas by daylight. She appears at any time and at any place. From bustling streets to barren alleys, to derelict mountains and desolate peaks, in radiant and refulgent skies, or shadowed and starless night... Anything
                        is possible — anything can become full of wonder. Hu Tao is an undecipherable riddle, but people don't lament their lack of an answer. If asked, they would say, "This is the natural order of things, right? Funeral ceremonies allow
                        mortals to leave this world with dignity. And Liyue's Wangsheng Funeral Parlor is said to be painting the last strokes on the scrolls of people's lives in the most respectful way. Traditional funerals include multiple steps such
                        as holding a wake, burial, putting up a memorial plaque... All of which are subject to strict rules. Regardless of their social standing and level of wealth, all who depart deserve a ceremony that would do them honor. This is the
                        Wangsheng Funeral Parlor's client service philosophy. One would think that such a reputable organization ought to be led only by an individual of utmost learning and sagacity. Yet the heavy mantle of the 77th Director has fallen
                        on the shoulders of a young lady like Hu Tao. She has got quite a reputation in Liyue. Whenever someone mentions Hu Tao, their neighbors find it extremely hard to navigate the conversation. Although she is widely praised for her
                        wit and shrewdness, her eccentric notions are not as welcome, as she often lets her imagination run wild. As a three-year-old, she would read through volumes of classic texts while doing handstands. At six, she would cut classes
                        and fall asleep in coffins. When she was eight, she started living in the parlor and learning the etiquette of funeral ceremonies... One would never use the word "measured" to describe her behavior. During her teenage years, Hu
                        Tao was tasked with conducting a funeral ceremony for the first time. The parlor's undertakers and consultants were anticipating her debut with their stomachs in knots as if they were suspended over the peaks of Jueyun Karst.</p>

                    <h1>Ei/Baal/Raiden Shogun</h1>
                    <p>The Raiden Shogun is a firm believer of what she believes to be eternity—a place in which everything is kept the same, regardless of what goes on. She is honorable in her conduct and is revered by the people of Inazuma.While Ei has
                        a more stern demeanor than the average person, she is notably more emotive and sociable than the Shogun. Unlike the Shogun, Ei has preferences, such as a love for sweets and her passion in martial arts. Due to her dedication to
                        eternity, Ei is wary of the idea of change. However, she shows curiosity rather than disdain when it comes to new things, such as the appearance of the Traveler and the customs of the modern world. Due to having lost many of her
                        loved ones over the centuries, Ei is driven by a fear of further loss, wanting to preserve Inazuma for all eternity. To this end, she sealed herself in the Plane of Euthymia to keep herself from the effects of erosion, While in
                        the Plane of Euthymia, Ei was indifferent to anything that did not affect her pursuit of eternity and had a low opinion of human ambition due to ambition leading to loss and suffering, thus making it incompatible with eternity.
                        Even in the Plane of Euthymia, however, she could not truly escape loneliness, as she was happy to see her friend Yae Miko again, and she genuinely enjoys the Traveler and Paimon's company. Ei has a weakness against desserts and
                        sweet things. Her view is that desserts can't pose any serious obstacle to her pursuit of Eternity to the extent that in any case of cavities, she could just replace her tooth. Yae Miko and Venti also mentioned about her fondness
                        against desserts, with the Anemo Archon even suggesting that the Traveler bring her desserts to exploit the said vulnerability. During her story quest, when asked by Traveler, Ei explained that since humans enjoyed desserts, she
                        should enjoy it as well. Ei also has an aversion to cooking, saying that she can do anything but that. In spite of her flawed actions, Ei truly loves Inazuma as her sister did and just wants to protect it and her people for all
                        eternity. After she is convinced that her actions were wrong, Ei shows remorse and is willing to change her perspective regarding eternity and become a better ruler for her people.</p>

        <h1>
            Lets discus the project.</h1>
        <p>Recently, Genshin Impact has gotten a lot of attention for its beautiful open world and enormous cast of playable characters. However, the game has a story that is equally intriguing. Set in the world of Teyvat, the game's setting is a land of
            many nations, each conforming to a specific element and worshiping a corresponding elemental god. Early on in Genshin Impact's story, twins are battling an unnamed god. Players choose whether they wish to be the male or female twin, and the
            other twin gets captured while the player's twin is sealed away. The player's twin reawakens after some time has passed, and joins a fairy-like creature named Paimon on a journey to find the lost twin. Deemed the Traveler, players explore
            the open world of Teyvat with Paimon and a roster of other playable characters in Genshin Impact. The first part of the main Genshin Impact story concerns Stormterror, a once-peaceful dragon that is now attacking the kingdom of Mondstadt.
            Alongside the Knights of Favonius and the wind god Barbatos, the Traveler and Paimon work to calm Stormterror and bring Mondstadt peace. Along the way, players join forces with several of Genshin Impact's starter characters, most of whom are
            members of the Knights of Favonius. A group known as the Fatui is also introduced, although their machinations and motivations aren't fully revealed. Where Genshin Impact's Story Goes Next After the events in Mondstadt, players go to the next
            major area in the game: Liyue. While Mondstadt was all about the Anemo (wind) element, Liyue conforms to the Geo (earth) element. In order to discover more about the Fatui, and possibly the Traveler's lost twin, players must meet with Rex
            Lapis, the god who presides over Liyue. This part of the story introduces another faction, the Liyue Qixing, of which playable character Keqing is a member.</p>
